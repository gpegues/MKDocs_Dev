Wiki will be retired along the following stages: Stage 1: Rolled out (October 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD) Users won't be able to create new wikis, but they will be able to access\u2014that is, read and write for\u2014their existing wikis. Users can also export their content to OneNote. Once a user has done so, the Wiki version will be read-only. After exporting, each wiki in a channel will appear as a separate section in OneNote, and each wiki page will be a separate OneNote page. Stage 2: Early October 2023 (November 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD) In this stage, channels' Wiki tabs will no longer be supported. Users will still be able to access\u2014that is, read and write\u2014content in the Wiki app. It will be easy to navigate from the deprecated channel Wiki tabs to the Wiki app. Users will also be able to export their content to OneNote. As in Stage 1, it will no longer be possible to create new wikis. Stage 3: January 2024 (April 2024 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD) From this point onward, neither Wiki tabs nor the Wiki app will be accessible through Teams. Users will no longer have the ability to export their wikis. However, users will still be able to download their wiki files from SharePoint. Can I export my wikis in bulk? No. Users will need to export wikis one by one using the Wiki tab. Who can export a wiki to a Notes tab? Any team member who has the ability to add or remove a tab in a channel can export their wiki. What will happen to wikis in private channels? Private channel wikis will also be deprecated.

Powered by OneNote: This tab will leverage OneNote for enhanced note-taking capabilities, including easy collaboration, rich editing options, and effective search functionalities. Organization & Access: All notes for a channel will be organized within a dedicated section in the team's default OneNote notebook. Action Required \u00b6 Adapting to Change (Training): Familiarize yourself with OneNote for seamless integration into your Teams usage. Migrate your Wiki data: Migration of your Wiki data to Onenote is required and is a user driven action. An additional document will also be provided with user oriented migration instructions, as this process is intended to be completed by members of the respective Team where the wiki resides. FAQs \u00b6 Microsoft is implementing these changes over the next several months in stages. There are no specific dates, only general timelines. Rollout Start: Mid-November 2023 Rollout Completion: Late November 2023 Stage 1: Initial Roll out (October 2023/November 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD) Users won't be able to create new wikis, but they will be able to access\u2014that is, read and write for\u2014their existing wikis. Users can also export their content to OneNote. Once a user has done so, the Wiki version will be read-only. After exporting, each wiki in a channel will appear as a separate section in OneNote, and each wiki page will be a separate OneNote page.\u202f Stage 2: Early October 2023 (November 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD) In this stage, channels' Wiki tabs will no longer be supported. Users will still be able to access\u2014that is, read and write\u2014content in the Wiki app. It will be easy to navigate from the deprecated channel Wiki tabs to the Wiki app. Users will also be able to export their content to OneNote. As in Stage 1, it will no longer be possible to create new wikis. Stage 3: January 2024 (April 2024 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD) From this point onward, neither Wiki tabs nor the Wiki app will be accessible through Teams. Users will no longer have the ability to export their wikis. However, users will still be able to download their wiki files from SharePoint. We understand that changes like this can impact how you work in Teams. We are here to support you through this transition.

Please note, eDiscovery is not a backup solution and should NOT be used as one. Introduction \u00b6 This document defines the process for dealing with eDiscovery in regard to Litigation Hold and Public Record requests. Please note, eDiscovery is not a backup solution and should NOT be used as one. Core (Standard) eDiscovery - What is Microsoft 365 Core (Standard) eDiscovery? \u00b6 Microsoft Core (Standard) eDiscovery builds on the basic capabilities of the Content Search tool. Core (Standard) eDiscovery allows administrators and users with relevant permissions to create an eDiscovery case, search for content located in different Microsoft services, preview and export the search results, add managers to the case, place holds, etc. For RCIT, this is one of our tools for processing Litigation Hold requests for Riverside County. It is separate from its \u201cAdvanced Premium\u201d version of the product, which is an additionally licensed item, covered later in this document. Either technology can be used to complete a Litigation Hold/Public Records request at the time of this writing. Core (Standard) eDiscovery - How to create a Core eDiscovery Case \u00b6 Step 1: Navigate to the Security and Compliance center. Step 2: Click \u201cCore eDiscovery\u201d under the \u201ceDiscovery\u201d drop-down on the navigation menu on the left-hand side of the screen. Step 3: Type a case name and a description (optional) and click \u201cSave\u201d Step 4: Select the case to navigate to the case page and take further action. Core (Standard) eDiscovery - How to run an eDiscovery search in a Core eDiscovery case? \u00b6 The eDiscovery Search tool can be used to search for content across Microsoft 365 data sources using keywords and conditions. The results of the search can then be exported to a local computer. Step 1: Navigate to the Security and Compliance center. Click \u201cCore eDiscovery\u201d under the eDiscovery drop-down on the navigation menu bar on the left-hand side of the screen. Step 2: Click \u201cSearches'' from the top menu bar.

Step 5: Add conditions for the search if needed. This could include specific keyword(s) and add conditions to search for the keyword. Click \u201cNext\u201d. Step 6: Review the search and click \u201cSubmit\u201d. Once the content search run is complete, administrators can take further action like \u201cEdit search,\u201d \u201cRerun search,\u201d etc. They can also export the search results as a .csv or a compressed .zip file by clicking \u201cExport results\u201d. Core (Standard) eDiscovery - How to create a hold in a Core eDiscovery case \u00b6 Step 1: Navigate to the Security and Compliance center Step 2: Click \u201cCore eDiscovery\u201d under the \u201ceDiscovery\u201d drop-down on the navigation menu on the left-hand side of the screen. Step 3: Create an eDiscovery case or open an existing case. Step 4: Click \u201cHold\u201d on the top menu bar. Click \u201c+Create\u201d. Step 5: Enter a name for the hold and provide a description (optional). Click \u201cNext\u201d. Step 6: Choose the location (SharePoint sites, Exchange mailboxes or Exchange public folders). Click \u201cNext\u201d.Core eDiscovery hold Step 7: Enter the search query. Administrators can add a specific keyword and choose conditions to search for the query if needed Step 8: Review the settings and click \u201cSubmit\u201d. The hold will be created based on the chosen location or the query and or condition. It can take up to 24 hours for a hold to take effect. Once the hold is in place, it can be removed by an administrator whenever needed. When a hold is removed, a 30-day grace period is applied (called a delay hold) to prevent the content from being deleted. Microsoft 365 Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery \u2013 What is Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery? \u00b6 Microsoft Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery builds on the existing case management, preservation, search, and export functionalities of Core eDiscovery. With Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery, administrators can identify, collect, review, analyze, preserve, and export content relevant to any internal or external investigations. They can also collect data from any service, move it into review sets where they can add filters, search the content, tag and analyze it, and remove irrelevant content. from further review. Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery also helps manage custodians and legal hold notification workflows to communicate with custodians involved in any specific case. Advanced eDiscovery Glossary: \u00b6 Custodian: Custodians are users/people whose content an organization wants to specifically search for and gather as evidence ins any legal case. Non-custodial data sources: When a new collection is created, administrators can add non-custodial data sources. These could be sites or groups or any other sources that need to be included in the search. Review sets: In Advanced eDiscovery, data can be added to review sets where it can be reviewed, analyzed, tagged, and exported. Collections: Using collections, administrators can search for and collect live data from the Microsoft data sources. Microsoft 365 Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery \u2013 Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) \u00b6 EDRM or Electronic Discovery Reference Model is a framework that covers the standards for the process of discovering Electronically Stored Information. On a high level, the workflow of Advanced eDiscovery mimics that of the EDRM. Below is the Electronic Discovery Reference Model that presents a conceptual view of the eDiscovery process that can be replicated in an Advanced eDiscovery case. The Electronic Discovery Reference Model A Typical Advanced eDiscovery Case Workflow Microsoft 365 Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery \u2013 How to create an Advanced eDiscovery case \u00b6 Step 1: Navigate to the security and compliance center. Step 2: Click \u201cAdvanced eDiscovery\u201d under eDiscovery from the left-hand side menu bar. Step 3: Click \u201cCases\u201d on the menu bar on the top and click \u201c+ Create a case\u201d. Step 4: Enter a case name, case number, and a description (optional). Administrators can further add members to configure the analytical settings related to the case and the format. Click \"Save\". Microsoft 365 Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery \u2013 How to create collections in an Advanced eDiscovery case \u00b6 A collection in Advanced eDiscovery is like a content search run in a Core eDiscovery case. To create a collection, follow the below steps: Step 1: Navigate to the security and compliance center and click \u201cAdvanced eDiscovery\u201d under eDiscovery on the left-hand side menu bar. Step 2: Click \u201c+ Create a case\u201d or choose an existing case. Click \u201cCollections\u201d on the top menu bar and click \u201c+ New collection\u201d. Step 3: Enter the name and description (optional) of the collection, add custodians, non-custodial data sources, additional locations, conditions for the collection, save the collection as draft or add it directly to a review set. Admins can review the collections once the collection process is done. Microsoft 365 Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery - Access permissions requirements for end users \u00b6 To access the features available within Microsoft eDiscovery a user needs appropriate permissions. These permissions can be assigned by the Compliance Administrator or the Global Administrator on the Security and Compliance center. Apart from the Compliance Administrator and the Global Administrator, users in the eDiscovery Manager and eDiscovery Administrator role group can perform eDiscovery related tasks. eDiscovery manager and eDiscovery administrator are sub-groups that fall under the eDiscovery manager compliance center role. Users can be added to these sub-groups by navigating to the eDiscovery manager group under the Permissions page. eDiscovery Manager: An eDiscovery manager can only manage the case that they create. They can create and manage Core and Advanced eDiscovery cases, create case holds, run searches, preview, and export search results, add and remove members, and access case data. eDiscovery Administrator: An eDiscovery administrator can perform all the tasks that the eDiscovery manager can. Additionally, an eDiscovery administrator can access all the Core and Advanced eDiscovery cases listed in the compliance center. The sub-groups can then be edited individually to add users to either of the roles by navigating to Compliance Center> Permissions> eDiscovery Manager> Edit role group. RCIT \u2013 eDiscovery Request Fulfillment Process \u2013 Service Now \u2013 Pre-requisites \u00b6 Pre-requisites for Request Submission Generally, the RCIT Messaging Team will only process a Litigation Hold or Content Search request under the following circumstances: Request MUST come though a Service Now Task \u2013 under the appropriate task category. This is officially shown in Service Now as a \u201cLitigation Hold and Public Records Service Request\u201d. Email requests will not be serviced. Litigation Hold and Public Records Service Request must have appropriate information listed containing all required content search keywords (spelled correctly), full email accounts of both internal and external participants, and projected time frames. Additional information should still be provided if available. Personal or Shared Inbox/Email communications regarding said above items will not be accepted, for potential legal concerns, and properly timestamped record keeping. All communications regarding an eDiscovery request should be done through the customer notes portion of the Service Now task. Network location or Sharepath for delivery of data once exported. Item not in compliance with the above standards will be closed if not updated with the needed information within 48 of our initial processing attempts. In the event a customer does not respond to a Service Now email requesting additional information after two business days, the ticket will be closed, and a re-submission will be required. RCIT \u2013 eDiscovery Request Fulfillment Process \u2013 Processing a Request \u00b6 If all items in RCIT \u2013 eDiscovery Request Fulfillment Process \u2013 Service Now \u2013 Pre-requisites have been provided successfully, you will follow the steps from either of the following methodologies notated in previous pages of this document to begin the request: Note: Prior to proceeding, remember to notate any case created with the Service Now Task Number for reference Core (Standard) eDiscovery - How to create a Core eDiscovery Case and additional supporting documentation Or Microsoft 365 Advanced (Premium) eDiscovery \u2013 How to create an Advanced eDiscovery case and additional supporting documentation Example RCIT \u2013 eDiscovery Request Fulfillment Process \u2013 Exporting Discovered Content and Providing to User \u00b6 Content exported is provided in PST format, and depending on size of the search, may be broken into several PSTs as a result. Please refer to step 6 of Core (Standard) eDiscovery - How to run an eDiscovery search - for instructions on exporting. When exporting data for one of these requests, Messaging should also provide a report containing items pertaining to the search and criteria ran (also shown in Step 6 above) bundled with the results. Unless otherwise specified by Management, default options should be used, with \u201cEnable de-duplication for Exchange Content\u201d enabled. Example For initial content downloads \u2013 You can also use the Managed Services general purpose server for this function, as it has drive volume to accommodate larger export scenarios: RCIT-19TSBP01 (10.19.142.161). It is currently recommended that any information provided to a customer be uploaded to a location only the requestors have access to, unless otherwise notated in Service Now by the submitter. RCIT \u2013 eDiscovery Request Fulfillment Process \u2013 Ticket and Case Closure \u00b6 After delivery of Case data to customer, the customer should be asked when we can close the Case and remove any hold on the mailbox. Upon agreeance on this, update Service Now with this information and close both the Service Now Ticket as completed and close the corresponding item in the Compliance Center. Further information to be added shortly RCIT \u2013 Licensing and Mailbox Information \u00b6 Regarding M365 Licensing and mailbox retention, some items to note are as follows: Litigation Hold: If a hold is place upon a mailbox, and the subsequent anchoring object is deleted from AAD, the mailbox will become what is known as an inactive mailbox. As such, it will be hidden from the address book. Please note, that if the mailbox exceeds 50GB in size, it will still require an Exchange License in this scenario. Further information will be added in coming weeks","title":"eDiscovery Litigation"},{"location":"Exchange/eDiscoveryLitigation/#introduction","text":"This document defines the process for dealing with eDiscovery in regard to Litigation Hold and Public Record requests.

Further updates can and should be made to this document by additional members of the Messaging Team. General Information \u00b6 While not common, you will receive incident and/or task escalations which will require the Messaging Team to act by utilizing the mass removal email from mailboxes. This can occur from one of several (but not limited to) possible scenarios below: Rivco Mailbox User accidentally sends out unintended mail to a large number of mailboxes internally. We will define \u201ca large number of mailboxes\u201d as 100 or more recipients as of the time this document was drafted. Rivco Mailbox Users have mass received a malicious email which was not detected/quarantined by our security protocols (Proofpoint, etc.) Requests from Management. Info - Email Removal Request - Services Messaging cannot provide \u00b6 Messaging cannot remove mail cached on mobile/iOS devices. Messaging cannot retrieve mail which has been sent to an external recipient Info - Email Removal Request \u2013 Admin Requirements \u00b6 Permission required to search mailboxes and delete messages: The account must be a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group or be assigned the Compliance Search management role. Permission required to delete messages: The account must be a member of the Organization Management role group or be assigned the Search and Purge management role Permission required to preview messages: The account must be a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group or be assigned the Preview management role PowerShell must be connected to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell. This requires you to import the ExchangeOnlineManagement module in PowerShell and open a connection with the compliance center (Purvue). Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName \"yourusername@contoso.com\" Info Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell: Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell Info - Email Removal Request \u2013 Ticket Information Requirement (INC) \u00b6 Once an email removal request has been received, you will want to gather as much data as possible about the message that needs to be deleted. Without obtaining precise data and search criteria, you will run the risk of potentially creating a query which may result in unintentionally deleting unintended email. Critical information required prior to processing a request What is the sender\u2019s email address? (Required) What is the message subject? (Required) Are there file attachments, and what are the filenames? What\u2019s the date of the first reported occurrence? Who are the recipients? Items listed above in red are requirements. Requests lacking this information will be rejected and sent back to the escalating individual or submitter. Email Removal Request \u2013 Create Content Search \u00b6 There are multiple ways to create a content search, both via PowerShell and through the Compliance portal (Compliance.microsoft.com). This document will cover only the PowerShell aspect of this task, as removal actions after creating a content search are not present in the Compliance Portal, which require PowerShell to complete. Example Request: Remove email with the following criteria Subject: You must change your bank password now Sent: 05/12/2020 Using the New-ComplianceSearch cmdlet in PowerShell, the message properties listed above will be used to create a search query. The key to keeping the search results as accurate as possible depends on the adequately formulated search criteria. Example This creates a compliance search with the -Name provided being the name of the search for further interactions. ContentMatchQuery is the input for search parameters. New-ComplianceSearch -Name Phish1 -ExchangeLocation All -ContentMatchQuery 'subject:\"You must change your bank password now\" AND sent:05/12/2020' This creates the search; however, it does not start it. To start the search continuing with the above example, you would use the following command supplied with the -Name you gave the search: Start-ComplianceSearch -Identity Phish1 After starting this search, this may take several minutes to the upwards of an hour to complete. To check the status of this search, running the following will give you a status: Get-ComplianceSearch -Identity Phish1 If \u201cStatus\u201d does not equal \u201cComplete\u201d , you will need to wait for this process to finish before proceeding. If you would like to check the number of items indexed through the Content Search, one way to obtain this (but not limited to) would be as follows: Get-ComplianceSearch -Identity Phish1 | Format-List * Email Removal Request \u2013 Previewing Search Results \u00b6 Prior to email deletion, you should review the result of your search. To preview the search results, you now need to create a preview action using the command below. New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName Phish1 -Preview This will start processing a job like we did prior in the Email Removal Request \u2013 Create Content Search step. This will also take the name you gave the search and append an _Preview to its name. Example: Phish1_Preview Once these results have completed. You can then run the following command to get the output of the results: ( Get-ComplianceSearchAction Phish1_Preview | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Results ) -split \",\" Note: This report can also be exported from the Compliance Center as a secondary option Email Removal Request \u2013 Delete email from inboxes \u00b6 To delete the messages that matched the search criteria, you need to create a purge job using the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet with the -Purge switch and -PurgeType parameter. Important: -PurgeType parameter SoftDelete will move all mail into the effected mailboxes recovery inbox. This also means that a user may be able to recover this email if they go into the recovery folder and restore. For permanent deletion use parameter HardDelete Additionally, unlike New-ComplianceSearch once you run this command, the job will automatically start. Once run, you will be unable to recover email (if needed) if using the HardDelete parameter. Proceed with caution. Example New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName Phish1 -Purge -PurgeType SoftDelete Like preceding items, this will create a purge job, affixed with the tag _Purge . This can be used to view the final result. Example Get-ComplianceSearchAction -Identity Phish1_Purge | Format-List Email Removal Request \u2013 Service Now Ticket Closure Requirements \u00b6 After completion of an Email Removal Request. We need to place resolution data in the submitted Service Now ticket. This would include compliance search query, and its final result after completing steps in Email Removal Request \u2013 Delete email from inboxes . Until this is further improved upon, the recommendation is that we attach the following to each completed request: The report query which shows the compliance search parameters and discovered items \u2013 This can be done in one of several ways: PowerShell Export or a CSV Export from the Compliance Center using the case name. If opting for PowerShell, please follow the native export formatting from the Compliance Center to keep items consistent. An export of the Get-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet, attached or pasted into the work notes. Get-ComplianceSearchAction -Identity Phish1_Purge | Format-List The reason for this, is that in the event of any questions or audits on why we have completed a request of this nature, it allows for Service Now to be the center point of determining why something was completed.

This includes Distribution Groups, Dynamic Distribution Groups, Mail-Enabled Security Groups, and Microsoft 365 Groups. Each serves unique purposes and offers different features to meet the diverse needs of organizations. Distribution Groups \u00b6 What is a Distribution Group? \u00b6 A Distribution Group, sometimes known as a mailing list, is a collection of email recipients that is addressed as a single recipient. It allows you to send email to multiple people within an organization without the need to add each recipient's email address individually. Key Features \u00b6 Static Membership : Members are added manually by group owners. Simplicity : Ideal for stable groups where the members do not change frequently. Control : Distribution Group Owners have complete control over group membership. Easy to Set Up : Can be quickly created and managed through Exchange admin center or PowerShell. Use Cases \u00b6 Team Communication : Perfect for teams that require regular updates. Announcements : Useful for sending notifications or announcements to a specific set of people. Collaboration : Enhances collaboration among departments or project teams. Dynamic Distribution Groups \u00b6 What is a Dynamic Distribution Group? \u00b6 A Dynamic Distribution Group is an advanced type of distribution group where membership is based on specific recipient filters rather than a fixed list of members. The members of the group are determined each time an email is sent to the group, based on the filters set by the administrator. Key Features \u00b6 Dynamic Membership : Members are automatically added or removed based on predefined filters (e.g., department, job title, location). Time-Saving : Eliminates the need for manual updates to group membership. Flexibility : Ideal for large and evolving organizations where group membership frequently changes. Customizable Criteria : Allows for complex membership rules based on various user attributes. No User Management : Users are automatically added/removed from group based off pre-set queries for inclusion. Use Cases \u00b6 Automated List Management : Automatically includes all users in a specific department or role. Organizational Changes : Efficiently manages communications in rapidly changing organizational structures. Targeted Communication : Ensures that emails are only sent to relevant recipients based on current attributes. Mail-Enabled Security Groups \u00b6 What is a Mail-Enabled Security Group? \u00b6 Mail-Enabled Security Groups are similar to Distribution Groups but with added security functionalities. They can be used to distribute messages as well as to grant access permissions to resources in Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint. Key Features \u00b6 Dual Functionality : Combines email distribution and security group functionalities. Resource Access Control : Can be used to manage permissions for resources like SharePoint sites. Centralized Management : Manage both communication and security from a single group. Use Cases \u00b6 Integrated Communication and Security : Ideal for teams that require both regular communication and access to shared resources. Project Management : Efficient for managing project-related communications and resource access. Microsoft 365 Groups \u00b6 What are Microsoft 365 Groups? \u00b6 Microsoft 365 Groups is a service that works across Microsoft 365 tools. It provides a single identity for teams in Office 365 and equips them with a shared workspace for various applications like Outlook, SharePoint, and Planner. Key Features \u00b6 Integrated Workspace : Offers shared Outlook inbox, calendar, SharePoint library, and planner. Collaboration Across Applications : Seamlessly integrates with various Microsoft 365 applications. External Collaboration : Allows for easy collaboration with people outside the organization. Self-Service Management : Users can create their own groups and manage memberships. Use Cases \u00b6 Team Collaboration : Streamlines collaboration across different Microsoft 365 applications. Project Management : Provides a centralized space for all project-related communication and documentation. External Partnerships : Facilitates collaboration with external stakeholders.","title":"Distribution Group Types"},{"location":"Exchange/UserDocumentation/M365-ExchangeOnline%20Distribution%20Group%20Types/#microsoft-365-exchange-online-distribution-group-types","text":"","title":"Microsoft 365 - Exchange Online: Distribution Group Types"},{"location":"Exchange/UserDocumentation/M365-ExchangeOnline%20Distribution%20Group%20Types/#overview","text":"Microsoft 365 Exchange Online offers a range of group types for enhancing communication and collaboration.

If permissions are changed by a calendar owner at a future time, or the individual already has an active connection to a calendar being re-shared with them in their Outlook client, it is recommended that the recipient remove the prior version of the calendar from their Outlook client to ensure permissions are appropriately updated. Failure to do this can result in users receiving access related errors to the calendar. Calendar Best Practices \u00b6 Effective use of an Outlook Calendar involves following best practices to ensure proper functionality. - Source: Microsoft Best Practices Process all meeting requests and cancellations \u00b6 Although you can delete a meeting request directly from your Inbox, you should properly process the meeting request by either accepting or declining it. Always use the Remove from Calendar command to process meeting cancellations from your Inbox. Avoid processing meetings directly from the Calendar module. Failure to do this can result in broken event functionality, that both Microsoft and RCIT will be unable to restore, as this is no current Microsoft support in the product for this, at the time of this writing. In the event where a calendar becomes unmanagable by its original organizer, you will need to recreate the event and re-invite all original participants. Prior participants will also need to manually remove the prior version of the meeting manually. Working with recurring meetings \u00b6 Set end dates and limit the number of occurrences Outlook makes it easy to schedule a meeting that has multiple regular occurrences. We recommend that you always set an end date and limit the recurring series to a specific number of occurrences. Most likely, recurring meetings will require modifications at some point. For example, attendees will be added to or removed from a single occurrence, or the meeting location or time will change due to vacation dates or unforeseen circumstances. Outlook saves each of these unique changes as a meeting exception. Meetings with a very large number of exceptions result in a meeting series that is difficult to manage. Additionally, it can introduce unexpected behavior. You can always create a new meeting series when the current one ends. When thinking about the number of occurrences, consider the frequency. In the period of a year, a twice weekly meeting will have about 90 more occurrences than a monthly meeting during that same period. End a recurring meeting before the original end date Although you can cancel a recurring meeting, a better option is to change the end date for the series. This allows you and the attendees to keep a record of the meetings that occurred in the past. If you cancel the recurring meeting altogether, that history is lost. The best option is to set a new end date and then send the update to all attendees. This ends the meeting series early, while keeping a record of previous meetings. Change the organizer \u00b6 Outlook does not provide a way to change a meeting organizer. To change the meeting organizer of a recurring meeting, end the recurring meeting. To do this, set an earlier end date and send the update to all attendees. After you complete this step, the new organizer should create a new recurring meeting. For more information about setting an earlier end date, see Cancel a meeting Avoid using a recurring meeting to share attachments \u00b6 Attachments add to the complexity of recurring meeting exceptions. Each exception contains its own copy of the attachments. As exceptions are added to recurring meetings, new copies of the attachments are created. If you make changes to one set of attachments, these changes do not propagate to the other exceptions. If you require that all attendees have the most recent copy of changes for any given meeting, share the documents via a sharing service, such as OneDrive. Enterprise users can take advantage of SharePoint or other shared file server on the network. Note: The actions of adding and removing attachments to standalone, non-recurring meetings are fully supported. Avoid copying meetings \u00b6 By design, Outlook removes any links between a copied meeting and the original meeting. This helps prevent inconsistencies. Newer versions of Outlook add the text string \"Copy:\" to the subject. This makes it easy to identify meeting copies. Actions related to copied meetings yield unexpected results, so we recommend avoiding copying meetings. This applies to both meetings copied from another user's calendar, as well as those copied from another calendar folder that you own. For more information about how to move meetings that you organized to another calendar folder, see: How to move Outlook meetings without losing the option to \" Send Update \" Please note, RCIT cannot restore events which have been copied, and this should be avoided when possible. Performing this is at your own risk. Maintain add-ins that integrate with Outlook \u00b6 Most, if not all, Outlook add-ins access Outlook data. An add-in may change an Outlook item that you are editing at the same time, whether in Outlook or on another device. This can introduce conflicts. To minimize the likelihood, make sure to install the latest updates for any add-ins or programs that integrate with Outlook. Uninstall or disable any of these programs and add-ins that you do not use or that do not need to integrate with Outlook. Note: In some cases, multiple Outlook clients and devices may modify items at the same time, which can introduce conflicts. To minimize the likelihood, do not process the same item on two or more clients or devices within a relatively short period of time. Limit the number of Calendar Delegates \u00b6 Outlook does not limit the number of delegates that you can add. However, we recommend that you only grant Editor permissions to one (1) delegate. This allows you to track when and how a meeting was processed. Considering the fact that a delegate can use multiple devices to access your data, having many delegates with Editor permissions makes it very difficult to determine why meetings are missing or out of date. Even if you only grant Editor permissions to one delegate, avoid adding a large number of delegates with Reviewer or Contributor permissions. This is because adding large numbers of delegates may exhaust other resources. For example, the size limit for rule data may be reached. When you add a delegate, various changes take place: Outlook applies permissions to relevant folders. The PublicDelegates Active Directory attribute is updated to add \"Send on Behalf of\" permissions to the delegate. Outlook adds the delegate to a forward rule on the manager's mailbox. This forwards meeting requests to the delegate. Outlook saves additional delegate information in the manager's mailbox. Each of these component areas may have different limits. Nearing these limits can affect performance and stability. RCIT cannot change, fix, or resolve problem arisen from using calendars beyond recommended limitations, as these are product limitations at the Microsoft level. Additional Notes: During development and testing of modern Outlook calendar functionality, Microsoft used a maximum of four (4) delegates. RCIT does not recommend or support going beyond this limit. If a delegate with Editor permissions must be replaced either temporarily or indefinitely, change the permissions from Editor to Reviewer or none. Then, grant Editor permissions to the new or backup delegate. Unsupported Calendar Items \u00b6 Current limitations regarding RCIT support for Outlook calendar functionality and behavior. Limitations and Unsupported Items \u00b6 Calendar Events and Meetings: RCIT cannot reassign, recover, or restore functionality to events, meetings, or organizers. Deleted Items Recovery: RCIT has very limited ability to recover deleted calendar items. Personal Device Synchronization: Support for syncing issues on personal, non-corporate devices is not supported. Customization Restrictions: RCIT only supports default interface and functionality for the base Outlook Client experience. RCIT cannot support the above items due to the absence of administrative support within the product itself. These items are behaving as designed by Microsoft at the current time of writing this document. Should we have the ability to provide more robust service regarding these items in the future, we will update this document to reflect this.

Email Retention Policies \u00b6 Email retention in Exchange Online is managed through Messaging Records Management (MRM), which uses retention tags and retention policies to automate archiving and deletion of emails. Key Concepts \u00b6 Retention Tags : Define how long to retain items and what action to take (delete or archive). Default Policy Tag (DPT) : Applies to all untagged items. Retention Policy Tag (RPT) : Applies to default folders (e.g., Inbox, Deleted Items). Personal Tag : Users can apply these tags to individual messages or folders. Retention Policies : Collections of tags applied to mailboxes. Each mailbox can have only one retention policy assigned at a time. Reference: Microsoft Docs \u2013 Retention Tags and Policies Retention Policy Table \u00b6 The following table outlines our current email retention rules: Name Type Retention Period Retention Action Retention Policy Available to Users Description 1 Month Delete Personal 30 days Delete Not specified No A personal tag that deletes items after 30 days.

Reference: Retention for Microsoft Teams Mailbox Retention Requests \u00b6 Departments may request to retain a former employee's mailbox. This option is selected during the Service Now Termination process and are ingrained in these request forms dependent on a requestor's selection to the \"Does the department want to retain any email\" option. If \"Yes\" is selected, the submitter is shown additional options for retention. These options are as follows: What date can the inbox be deleted? Please select the employee to grant \"delegate\" full access to review the inbox Conditions for Retained Mailboxes \u00b6 Mailbox \u2264 50GB : Can be converted to a shared mailbox; no license is required. Mailbox > 50GB : Requires an active license; costs billed to the requesting department. Reference: Convert a Mailbox Mailbox Deletion Lifecycle \u00b6 When an employee departs, their mailbox goes through a two-phase deletion process: Soft Deletion : The mailbox is marked for deletion but remains recoverable for 30 days. During this period, the mailbox can be restored if needed. Hard Deletion : After the 30-day soft deletion period, the mailbox is permanently deleted and cannot be restored. If a Litigation Hold has been applied to the entire mailbox, or if a Content Hold has been placed on specific items within the mailbox due to a current legal hold, the mailbox will transition to what is known as an Inactive Mailbox at the time of hard deletion. This ensures that the mailbox is preserved for compliance purposes. Inactive Mailboxes \u00b6 Definition : An inactive mailbox is a mailbox that has been preserved for compliance purposes, such as litigation hold or content hold, and is no longer active or discoverable for regular use outside of Microsoft Purvue and Exchange Online Adminstrators. Inactive mailboxes are retained to ensure that all data is available for eDiscovery and compliance reviews. How a Mailbox Becomes Inactive : - Litigation Hold : When a litigation hold is applied to the entire mailbox, and Hard Deletion occurs, it is preserved in its entirety, including all items and folders. The mailbox becomes inactive but is not deleted, ensuring that all data is retained for the duration of the hold. - Content Hold : When a content hold is applied to specific items within the mailbox, and Hard Deletion occurs, those items are preserved and cannot be deleted. The rest of the mailbox follows the standard deletion lifecycle, but the held items remain accessible for eDiscovery and compliance purposes. Comparison: Content Hold vs. Litigation Hold \u00b6 Feature Content Hold (Purview Policy) Litigation Hold Scope Only content matching policy Entire mailbox Preserves deleted items? Only matching content Yes (all items) Overrides retention cleanup No Yes Applies to non-email?

If this attribute is null/empty, there's two potential issues: 1.) The employeeId is not yet in PeopleSoft, so has not synced down 2.) The employeeId value is taken by a different account. PeopleSoft cannot sync the attribute down to the new account if this attribute is synced to another account. This attribute must be unique.

The goal is to ensure data transparency while adhering to strict privacy, security, and regulatory standards. Why It Matters \u00b6 The \"Publish to Web\" feature makes a Power BI report publicly accessible without authentication . For government entities, this has serious implications for: - Data privacy and confidentiality - Regulatory compliance - Public trust and transparency Security & Compliance Recommendations \u00b6 1. Limit Use to Public-Facing Content Only \u00b6 Use this feature only for dashboards explicitly approved for public release , some examples might be: - Budget summaries - Public meeting schedules - Open data or transparency portals 2. Never Include Regulated or Sensitive Data \u00b6 Do not use \"Publish to Web\" with data protected under the following: Acronym Full Form Protects Applies To PII Personally Identifiable Information Identifiable personal details (e.g., SSNs, names, emails) All organizations, especially public sector PHI Protected Health Information Medical and health-related data Healthcare orgs under HIPAA CJIS Criminal Justice Information Services Criminal justice and law enforcement records Justice/law enforcement agencies FISMA Federal Information Security Management Act Federal systems and sensitive information Federal agencies and contractors FERPA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Student records and education data Schools and educational institutions HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Health data used in care, billing, etc. Covered healthcare entities and associates 3. Controlled Access via Security Group \u00b6 The \"Publish to Web\" feature is disabled for all users by default in the Power BI Admin Portal. Access is granted only through membership in the RBAC_PowerBI_AllowPublishToWeb security group . Managerial approval is required before a user is added to this group. 4. Provide Clear Public Disclaimers \u00b6 Every publicly shared report should include a disclaimer: \u201cThis dashboard is provided for informational purposes. No sensitive or confidential data is contained.\u201d Including a disclaimer is considered a best practice for public-facing dashboards. It sets clear expectations for data use, protects your agency from liability, and supports transparency. While not explicitly required by Microsoft, it is strongly encouraged for open data and transparency initiatives. Microsoft: Publish to web in Power BI - Considerations and limitations 5. Ensure Accessibility & Branding Compliance \u00b6 Ensuring accessibility and branding compliance means making sure your dashboards are inclusive, recognizable, and trustworthy for the public. Accessibility (Section 508 and WCAG) \u00b6 Section 508 is a U.S. federal law that mandates accessibility for digital content, ensuring people with disabilities can use your reports. WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are internationally recognized standards for creating accessible web content. Key practices include: - High-contrast visuals - Keyboard navigation support - Proper labeling of visuals and content - Screen reader compatibility Resources: - Section 508 Guidelines - WCAG Overview Technical Best Practices \u00b6 The following table outlines technical best practices that should be followed when using Power BI's \"Publish to Web\" feature. These recommendations aim to ensure usability, minimize risks, and enhance clarity for public users. Best Practice Recommendation Explanation Data Source Types Avoid DirectQuery, Live Connections, or RLS-based models These methods involve dynamic data or access controls that are not compatible with public publishing. DirectQuery : Queries the data source in real time, exposing live internal data. Live Connections : Used with services like Analysis Services, and relies on active backend models. RLS (Row-Level Security) : Restricts what data users can see based on identity. However, RLS is not enforced with Publish to Web, meaning all data becomes visible to anyone. For public reports, always use static, pre-aggregated data sources. Embed Responsibly Use iframe embedding on trusted domains only Iframe embedding allows you to place Power BI reports into external websites. By restricting this to trusted domains (e.g., official .gov or agency-owned domains), you prevent malicious sites from displaying or misusing your public dashboards. This limits the risk of data scraping, impersonation, or unapproved framing of your content. Optimize Report Performance Limit visuals and avoid heavy queries Simpler reports load faster for public users. Avoid too many visuals, slicers, or large datasets, as performance issues impact accessibility and user experience. Test Before Publishing Review layout and data visibility in incognito/private mode Before publishing, validate what external users will see. This includes checking formatting, responsiveness, and confirming no sensitive data is inadvertently shown. Use Descriptive Titles and Tooltips Clearly label visuals and include hover-over explanations Well-labeled charts and visuals help the public understand the data without needing context from internal teams. Use tooltips for added clarity on numbers or categories.","title":"Publish to Web"},{"location":"M365/PowerBI/PublishtoWebGuidelines/#power-bi-publish-to-web-guidelines-for-government-m365-tenants","text":"","title":"Power BI \"Publish to Web\" Guidelines for Government M365 Tenants"},{"location":"M365/PowerBI/PublishtoWebGuidelines/#overview","text":"This document outlines technical and compliance-based recommendations for using the \"Publish to Web\" feature in Power BI within a government Microsoft 365 (M365) tenant .

Official Whitepaper: Service Gateway Update Pre-Check \u00b6 Log into the Power BI Service Portal : https://app.powerbigov.com/ Navigate to : Manage Gateways and Connections \u2192 On-Premises Data Gateways \u2192 Open Gateway Cluster Details (e.g., RIVCO-OnPremDataGateway) . Verify all nodes are showing as \"Online\" and \"Enabled\" . \"Online\" = Gateway is connected and reachable. \"Enabled\" = Gateway is active and available for load balancing. If any nodes other than the one being brought down for maintenance are unhealthy or disabled unexpectedly, resolve issues before proceeding . You will need \"Tenant Administration\" enabled in Power BI Admin Portal to manage these settings. You can find gateway logs on the hosting servers to review for errors in the Windows OS Event Log under: \" Applications and Services Logs > On-premises sata gateway service \" Update and Reboot Process \u00b6 Important: Only process one node at a time. Step 1: Select and Disable the Node \u00b6 In the Power BI Service Portal: Navigate to the gateway cluster details. Find the server you plan to patch. Set the node to \"Disabled\" . You will need \"Tenant Administration\" enabled in Power BI Admin Portal to manage these settings. Note: This will gracefully remove it from the load balancer and allow running jobs to complete. Step 2: Wait for Active Jobs to Finish \u00b6 Wait approximately 30 minutes after disabling the node to ensure active tasks are completed. Step 3: Apply Windows/PBI Gateway Updates \u00b6 Apply the necessary Windows Server OS patches and/or PBI Gateway Update to the selected server. Step 4: Perform required updates to other applications as necessary \u00b6 Some gateway connectors rely on seperate applications to function. Current information regarding these applications may be found here. Step 5: Reboot the Server \u00b6 Perform a reboot. Step 6: Verify Node Reconnection \u00b6 After reboot, sign back into the Power BI Service Portal. Confirm: The node status is \"Online\" (Connected to Power BI Service). It shows \"Disabled\" (still not load-balanced yet). Note: This step is separated from re-enabling the node to ensure the server has fully restarted, the gateway service is healthy, and no issues are present before returning it to load-balanced traffic. This helps prevent service disruptions from unstable or misconfigured nodes. Step 7: Re-Enable the Node \u00b6 After confirming the node is online and stable, set the node back to \"Enabled\" in the cluster settings. This returns it to the active load balancer pool. Step 8: Repeat for Remaining Nodes \u00b6 Move to the next node and repeat Steps 1\u20136 until all nodes are updated and rebooted. Post-Update Validation \u00b6 Verify Gateway Cluster Health Confirm all nodes are showing \"Online\" and \"Enabled\" . Monitor Dataset Refreshes Check scheduled and manual refresh jobs to ensure no failures.

Objectives \u00b6 Ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to operations. Maintain data integrity throughout the migration process. Facilitate user adaptation to the new Teams environment. Pre-Migration Phase \u00b6 Assessment and Inventory (Week 1: January 22nd through January 26th) \u00b6 Evaluate Customization Requirements : Identify any specific configurations or customizations needed in the new Teams version. Teams Client Versions : Obtain endpoint version current adoption rates to determine further rollout strategy. User Communication and Training (Week 2: January 29th through Febuary 2nd) \u00b6 Announce Migration Plan : Inform RCIT staff about the migration timeline and what to expect. Teams Warning Banner : Starting on February 1 2024, any classic Teams users who haven\u2019t updated to new Teams will begin seeing an informational banner to remind them about the timeline for the auto update. This banner will appear in the main Teams client window at the top of the page (underneath the main bar). Note: This notification is enforced and displayed by Microsoft. It cannot be disabled. Schedule Training Sessions : Organize training for the new Microsoft Teams features. Migration Phase \u00b6 Initial Setup and Pilot Testing (Week 3: Febuary 5th through Febuary 9th) \u00b6 Set up Intune for Teams Deployment : Configure Microsoft Intune for opt in deployment of new Teams version. Conduct Pilot Migration : Migrate a small, controlled group using Intune and gather feedback. Adjust Migration Strategy : Make necessary adjustments based on pilot feedback. Optional Migration (Week 4-7: Febuary 12th through March 8th) \u00b6 Intune : Deploy \"Opt-In\" New Teams Version**: Use Microsoft Intune to deploy the new version of Teams to all users. Noficiation : Notification sent to BRM's and Agencies informing them of the required change and cut-off dates Forced Migration (Week 8: March 11th, 2024) \u00b6 Intune : Deploy Mandatory installation of New Teams Version to all users. Teams Admin : Enforce usage of new Teams via admin center Post-Migration Phase \u00b6 Monitoring and Support (Week 8-10) \u00b6 Continuous Monitoring : Regularly check the new Teams environment for issues. Provide Technical Support : Offer assistance for users encountering problems. Final Window for Update : Final two weeks for any Classic Teams user to update, or any unsupported legacy features which are still needed by consumers to either gain support, or have business cases readdressed elsewhere. Review and Documentation Update - Enforced version compliance (March 31st, 2024) \u00b6 Update IT Documentation : Reflect changes in internal documentation. Forced Update Compliance : Microsoft as of this date will display a message stating that Classic Teams is no longer availible for use. Clients running this build will be required to update, and the application will attempt to uninstall and install the modern build. Out of Date Clients : Will need to install new update and remove old build. If not done automatically as the Teams client will make an automatic attempt to do this, this will need to be done with the assistance of the Help Desk. Conclusion \u00b6 This plan aims for a structured transition to the new Microsoft Teams environment using Microsoft Intune, prioritizing minimal disruption and user adaptation. Conceptually this allows us to begin migration prior to March 2024, and allows us the ability to find resolutions for any classic to modern Teams client feature parity items prior to the March deadline for unexpected items.","title":"RCIT Microsoft Teams Migration Plan Using Microsoft Intune"},{"location":"Teams/TeamsMigration/RoughDraft/#rcit-microsoft-teams-migration-plan-using-microsoft-intune","text":"","title":"RCIT Microsoft Teams Migration Plan Using Microsoft Intune"},{"location":"Teams/TeamsMigration/RoughDraft/#introduction","text":"This document provides a detailed guide for IT Systems Administrators and Help Desk staff at RCIT for migrating from an older version of Microsoft Teams to the new version using Microsoft Intune.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Teams/TeamsMigration/RoughDraft/#objectives","text":"Ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to operations.

What Happens If We Can\u2019t Update Users to New Teams? \u00b6 Once classic Teams is no longer available for you, you're going to see a dialog similar to the one below, and classic Teams won't work for you anymore. Above is an image of a Teams dialog box that appears after classic Teams no longer works, if you're unable to be updated to the new Teams client. The notification box has a link to requirements and a button that takes you to Teams on the web. To use Teams after this point, installing the new Teams client is a requirement for usage, or use Teams on the web. Admin Experience \u00b6 What Admins Will See Until March 31, 2024 \u00b6 Admins have full control over their tenant\u2019s transition to new Teams via the Upgrade to the new Teams. For more detailed information, please refer to Microsoft's new teams deploy using policie documentation. A bulk installer, including offline capability, is provided for admins who want to deploy new Teams using their own tools and process and use Teams policies to move their users to the desired experience: Bulk upgrade to the new Microsoft Teams client . Microsoft highly recommends that admins who want more control or a more gradual rollout of new Teams take advantage of these tools and functionality to begin slowly transitioning their users to new Teams now. Policies can be targeted to individual users, groups of users, or your entire tenant to give you flexibility to release to users group by group while monitoring progress and feedback. What Admins Will Experience Starting March 31, 2024 \u00b6 Beginning March 31, 2024, all policy options within Teams Admin Center to control the transition to new Teams will be made unavailable or will no longer function for all users. After these options are removed, Microsoft will begin moving all users except VDI users back to the Microsoft controlled policy setting. After March 31, 2024, the Microsoft controlled policy setting will equate to the user being assigned the New Teams Only policy (this policy option will be released soon). This will allow them to transition the user to new Teams and then uninstall the classic Teams client. Learn more in the Upgrade to the new Teams using policies article. Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Users \u00b6 Can a user have both clients installed? Yes. However, only the new Teams client will work after March 31, 2024. If I have the new Teams client installed prior to March 31, 2024, will I have any additional action items? No. Admins \u00b6 What are the system requirements for the new Teams client? Please see the following Microsoft Documentation: Prerequisites What will happen with Teams administrative update policies? The update policies may still appear, but they won\u2019t be functional after March 31, 2024. When will classic Teams client stop being installed with M365 apps? This will stop happening on March 31, 2024. Do we need to remove the old client and/or also \"Teams-Wide Installer\" from legacy deployments? Yes. Microsoft recommends that you remove the classic Teams client once a user has fully transitioned to new Teams. It's security best practice to not leave software that is no longer operational installed on a machine. Microsoft will attempt to remove the classic Teams client on our behalf, but if this is blocked or prevented by your configuration or policies it will become our responsibility to conduct this removal ourselves. What can be done if users still need classic Teams due to a no longer supported feature? Unfortuantely, the level of change happening is not one within control of RCIT, and is a Microsoft level change. You will not be able to use Classic Teams after March 31, 2024, or June 30, 2024 if you meet specific conditions . Until that date you'll still have a banner announcing the end of classic Teams at the top of your client. Please reference this page for more information: Features that are changing in the new Microsoft Teams Client Devices \u00b6 Will classic Teams be removed automatically? Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams after March 31, 2024. If this fails, IT organizations must uninstall classic Teams for their users. When or how will it be removed, and what triggers the uninstall? This will happen after March 31, 2024. As each user receives the automatic update and switches to new Teams, an attempt will be made to uninstall classic Teams. The Installation/Uninstall can be triggered by launching the classic Teams client on and/or after March 31st, 2024. For more information, please see Microsoft's Teams Client Update Servicing Agreement literature. Are User settings migrated as part of the upgrade? Yes, however settings can only be only migrated once during the first time a user updates to new Teams. After that, no incremental migrations of setting changes will occur if the user switches back and forth between classic and new. For a list of items which are migrated, please refer to the following link for a detailed table of items: User Settings Migration Will classic Teams be removed for all users on a device? Yes. What if I need to use classic Teams after March 31, 2024? You won\u2019t be able to use classic Teams after March 31, 2024, or June 30, 2024 if you meet the conditions in the table at the start of the article.

It includes both the automatic updater and manual upgrade process, as recommended by the vendor. Keeping Cerberus up to date ensures security, performance, and compatibility improvements. Upgrading Cerberus FTP Server: Two Methods Explained \u00b6 When it comes to upgrading your existing installation of Cerberus FTP Server, there are two methods at your disposal: the built-in auto-updater and the manual upgrade using the latest installer. Both methods are detailed below for your convenience. Regardless of the chosen upgrade method, the installer follows a sequential process. It initiates by stopping the Cerberus FTP Server service, proceeds to uninstall the current installation, and concludes by installing the latest release. It's essential to note that the uninstallation strictly impacts the program files, leaving the server configuration and user settings untouched\u2014ensuring a seamless transition. The entire upgrade process typically takes around 5 minutes and seldom necessitates a system reboot. However, it's important to acknowledge that the Cerberus FTP Server service will be temporarily unavailable during the upgrade. IMPORTANT : Always create a backup of your users and settings from the Cerberus Tools menu before proceeding with the upgrade. Utilize the Backup Users and Settings option to generate a zip file encompassing all your Cerberus settings and users. During the update, if you intend to change the service account that Cerberus runs as, opt for the manual update method, described as Method 2 below. Updating through Method 1 utilizes a reduced UI mode, retaining the previous service account. Note: Official documentation is available here: Cerberus FTP Server \u2013 Update Instructions Prerequisites \u00b6 Administrative access to the Windows Server hosting Cerberus Internet access (for the auto-updater to connect over HTTPS) Access to Cerberus FTP Downloads if doing a manual update Backup of existing Cerberus configuration Backup Configuration \u00b6 Although the upgrade preserves settings, you should back up prior: In the UI, go to Tools > Backup Users and Settings Save the file to a secure location Method 1: Using the Auto-Updater \u00b6 Cerberus FTP Server includes a built-in automatic updater that streamlines the upgrade process. Open the Cerberus Admin Console . Navigate to the Help menu from the top bar. Select Check For Update . The Upgrade Check dialog will display your current version and any available update. If no update is available , the Update button will be disabled. Click Close to exit. If an update is available , the Update button will be enabled and release notes will be shown. Click Update to begin the upgrade. The Cerberus UI will close, and the installer will automatically launch (sometimes it can take a good 30 seconds or so before the update UI opens). Choose default options during installation. The installer will: Remove the old version Preserve all users and configuration settings One of two things may occur: It will auto-close respective processes, update accordingly and finish without letting you know that it's complete. You can check task manager for the Cerberus process and verify the version there. You may get an error about files/processes still in use. Continue the installation when prompted and be sure to restart when complete. After installation, Cerberus FTP Server will be running the latest version. Note : The updater connects to www.cerberusftpserver.com over HTTPS (port 443) . Method 2: Manually Download and Install \u00b6 Use this method if the auto-updater is not available or fails. Go to the Cerberus Download Page . Download the latest installer. Note: 32-bit versions are no longer supported as of Cerberus version 12 . In the Cerberus Admin Console: Go to File > Exit to close the UI. Open Services ( services.msc ) and stop the Cerberus FTP Server service to avoid restarts during install. Run the new installer (right-click > Run as Administrator ). Choose default options through the installation wizard. For the service account, select \"Use Current\" . The installer will: Uninstall the current version Preserve all users and configuration Install the latest version Once complete, Cerberus FTP Server will be upgraded and ready for use. Post-Update Validation \u00b6 Start the Cerberus FTP Server service if it did not start automatically. Open the Cerberus Admin Console to confirm the upgrade. Go to Help > About to verify the version number. Test SFTP functionality using a client like WinSCP or FileZilla . Check logs in the UI for any errors or warnings post-upgrade.","title":"Application Update"},{"location":"WebServerSupport/FTP/docs/Cerberus-ApplicationUpdate/#updating-cerberus-sftp-server-on-windows-server","text":"","title":"Updating Cerberus SFTP Server on Windows Server"},{"location":"WebServerSupport/FTP/docs/Cerberus-ApplicationUpdate/#purpose","text":"This document provides step-by-step instructions for updating Cerberus FTP Server on a Windows Server.

This configuration allows AD users to authenticate via their AD credentials and access the assigned file share. Step 1: Prepare the Active Directory Group and File Share \u00b6 Before configuring Cerberus FTP Server, ensure that you have an Active Directory group and a file share folder ready. - File Share Location: Cerberus group based FTP locations can be found at \" F:\\FTPROOT\\Dept \" on ZRCIT-16SFTP01.tzone.lcl - Find the department the request is for, and create a folder in that departments directory. - Note: You do not need to set permissions right now, this is done later by Cerberus. 1. Create an Active Directory (AD) Group \u00b6 If an existing AD group is being used, skip to Step 2. Otherwise, create a new group using the naming convention \"FTP-Cerberus_Dept_Purpose\" (e.g., FTP-Cerberus_RCIT_TestGroup) and record the associated TASK number in the Notes field for tracking. Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) . Navigate to the Departments OU, choose the appropriate department, and then access the Groups OU. Right-click and select New > Group . Enter a Group Name (e.g., FTP-Cerberus_RCIT_TestGroup ). Choose Group Type: Security and Group Scope: Global . Click OK to create the group. Add any necessary users to this AD group . 2. Create and Configure a File Share \u00b6 If the folder and share already exist, skip to Step 2. Since share permissions are inherited from the parent folder, you do not need to configure them manually. Cerberus will handle access controls. On the file server , create a new folder (e.g., F:\\FTPROOT\\Dept\\RCIT or F:\\FTPROOT\\Dept\\xyz ). Reminder: The default NTFS permissions set on directories in these locations are inherited, you do NOT need to modify NTFS permisssions. This will be controlled by Cerberus in a later step. Step 2: Creating a Group in Cerberus FTP Server \u00b6 Log into the Cerberus FTP Server Desktop Interface on ZRCIT-16SFTP01.tzone.lcl Open the Cerberus FTP Server administration console. Navigate to User Manager . Create a New Group In the User Manager , go to the Groups tab. Click New to create a new group. Enter a Group Name in the \" Group Basics \" window (e.g., FTP-Cerberus_RCIT_TestGroup ). Important: Whenever possible, ensure the group name matches exactly with its AD counterpart. While this may not always be feasible, it should be the standard practice for group creation. Enter the Folder Path (or navigate to the folder in the GUI). Cerberus will map this group to the filepath. Under \" File Permissions \", \" Folder Permissions \", and \" General Permissions \", configure access levels as desired: At time of this writing, we appear to grant all permissions unless otherwise specified. Click Apply to save the changes. Step 3: Binding the Group to an Active Directory (AD) Group \u00b6 Bind the Cerberus Group to an AD Group In the AD Users tab, under the User & Group Custom Mappings tab, select your newly created Cerberus group under Active Directory Group to Cerberus Group Mapping . Click New and enter the name of the AD Group to be useds in the AD Group section. Then, in the Cerberus Group field, enter the name of the Cerberus Group to map. Click Add Mapping Conclusion: End-User Experience \u00b6 Group members of the AD group should now see the configured folder alongside their \"Home\" FTP directory when accessing their FTP account. Navigating into that folder should provide them with all permissions set for that location and group.","title":"FTP Group Creation"},{"location":"WebServerSupport/FTP/docs/Cerberus-FTPGroupCreation/#user-guide-creating-and-configuring-groups-in-cerberus-ftp-server","text":"","title":"User Guide: Creating and Configuring Groups in Cerberus FTP Server"},{"location":"WebServerSupport/FTP/docs/Cerberus-FTPGroupCreation/#overview","text":"This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating a group in Cerberus FTP Server , binding it to an Active Directory (AD) group , and mapping it to a file share .

Troubleshooting \u00b6 \"Administrator PowerShell Required\" \u00b6 Problem : Script won't run Solution : 1. Right-click PowerShell 2. Select \"Run as Administrator\" 3. Click \"Yes\" when prompted \"File Not Found\" \u00b6 Problem : Config file missing Solution : - Verify the file is in C:\\CTW\\ - Check the filename matches exactly - Get the file from your admin if missing \"Cannot Connect to Infoblox\" \u00b6 Problem : Infoblox DNS validation fails during certificate requests Solution : Verify your server can reach: ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us Open PowerShell and type: Test-NetConnection ns2mgmt . riverside . ca . us -Port 443 Should see: TcpTestSucceeded : True If it fails, contact your network team: \"Please allow outbound access from this server to ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us:443\" \"Cannot Connect to Hub\" \u00b6 Problem : Instance won't join Hub Solution : Verify Hub URL is correct and running Verify Client Secret is correct Test connectivity: Test-NetConnection zhr - 16webt01 . rivcoca . org -Port 8080 If it fails, contact your network team: \"Please allow outbound access from this server to zhr-16webt01.rivcoca.org:8080\" \"Hub Instance Not Appearing\" \u00b6 Problem : Instance joined but doesn't show in Hub Solution : 1. Refresh the Hub page (press F5) 2. Wait 30 seconds and refresh again 3. Check Hub logs for errors: - Management Hub > Help > Logs 4. Verify Client Secret was correct \"Config Import Fails\" \u00b6 Problem : Configuration won't import Solution : - Make sure you have the configuration password - Ask your admin if you don't have it - Verify the JSON file isn't corrupted: - Try opening it in Notepad - Should contain readable text starting with { \"License Not Applied\" (Standalone Only) \u00b6 Problem : License key shows as invalid Solution : 1. Verify the license key is correct: ITDGXW33B3 2. If incorrect, contact your admin 3. You can manually apply after: - Open Certify The Web - Go to About > Enter License Key - Paste the correct key Support \u00b6 For issues or questions: Check this guide - Most issues are covered above Check PowerShell output - Error messages usually indicate the problem Contact your admin - They can help with: Network/firewall issues License key validation Infoblox credential problems Hub connection issues Configuration password What's Next? \u00b6 For Standalone \u00b6 Verify installation 1. Open Certify The Web UI 2. Go to Managed Certificates tab 3. Should see your imported certificates Test a renewal 1. Select a certificate 2. Click \"Test\" button 3. Should validate without errors For Hub Client \u00b6 Verify instance joined 1. Open Management Hub 2. Go to Certificates > Summary 3. Should see your instance listed Create a new certificate 1. Click Certificates > New 2. Select your instance as Target Instance 3. Add domain and request certificate 4. Hub handles everything Common Questions \u00b6 Q: Do I need to restart after deployment? A: Not required, but a restart is safe if desired. Q: Will my existing certificates be affected? A: No. The configuration import restores previous settings without making changes. Q: Can I run the script multiple times? A: Yes, it's safe to run again. Re-running won't cause issues. Q: What if the script fails halfway? A: You can run it again. It will complete the remaining steps. Q: Can I switch from Standalone to Hub later? A: Yes. Uninstall standalone and deploy as Hub Client. Your config exports can be reused. Q: What's the difference between Standalone and Hub?

Steps to Follow \u00b6 1. License Request \u00b6 Action: Server admin creates a request for the license. Note: CTW can be installed on any server (internal or in the tzone) needing to download SSL certificates. Requirement: The DNS Zone must be hosted by NS1 and NS2.Riverside.ca.us . Check DNS zone eligibility Abongo 2. Software Installation \u00b6 Action: After submitting the SNOW request, the server admin installs and updates the CTW software. Next Step: Remote access to the server to add license information. Create the connection string for Infoblox. Requirement: NS1.riverside.ca.us and NS2.riverside.ca.us must be authoritative for the required DNS zone. 3. Licensing and Credentials \u00b6 Action: Once licensed and credentials are entered, the server admin can create certificates. Credential Information: BServer : ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us IBView : External-NS1andNS2 IBCred : Username: svc_acme Password: Stored in 1Password Team Vault (This is under \"Infoblox\") IBIgnoreCert : $true (used due to a self-signed certificate on Infoblox) 4. Notification to System Administrator \u00b6 Action: System Administrator receives email alerts for expiring certificates. Email Content: Informs that RCIT has purchased a product to handle automated certificate renewal. Configured for DNS validation. Automatically renews and installs certificates every 3 months. 5. Using Certify The Web \u00b6 Product: Certify The Web - ACME for Windows (Let's Encrypt and other ACME CAs) Alternative: Sectigo is the primary method. CTW is optional for admins seeking automation. 6.

No additional steps needed for renewals. 7. Managed Certificate Notifications \u00b6 Action: Use the Certify The Web app on your server for detailed information. If registered on certifytheweb.com , summary info for all certificates is available. --- \u00b6 How Certify The Web (CTW) Works \u00b6 This guide outlines the certificate automation and deployment process using Certify The Web (CTW). 1. Start \u00b6 Trigger : Need to renew or create an SSL certificate. 2. Check Domain and DNS Records \u00b6 Action : Verify domain ownership through DNS verification. Decision : Yes : Domain ownership verified. No : DNS records need to be updated. 3. Create or Renew Certificate \u00b6 Action : Initiate the certificate creation or renewal process in CTW. 4. Select Certificate Type \u00b6 Options : Standard SSL : Simple domain-validated certificate. Wildcard SSL : Covers all subdomains. 5. Configure Certify The Web \u00b6 Steps : Enter domain names. Select validation method (DNS, HTTP, etc.). Choose the Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt). Set up auto-renewal options. 6. DNS Verification (If Applicable) \u00b6 Action : CTW updates DNS TXT records (via automation or manual update). Decision : Success : Proceed to the next step. Failure : Retry or perform manual intervention. 7. Generate Certificate \u00b6 Action : CTW generates the SSL certificate upon successful validation. 8. Post-Request Tasks \u00b6 Action : Set up post-request tasks to distribute and install the certificate. Options : Script Execution : Run PowerShell scripts for distribution. Automated Task : Use CTW tasks for installing on IIS or other services. 9. Deploy Certificate \u00b6 Action : Deploy the certificate to required services (e.g., IIS, load balancer). 10. Verify SSL Installation \u00b6 Action : Confirm the certificate is correctly installed and active. Decision : Success : Certificate is active. Failure : Troubleshoot installation issues. 11. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts \u00b6 Action : Configure monitoring and alerts for certificate validity and renewal. 12. End \u00b6 Result : SSL certificate is successfully automated and deployed.

Request Submission Prerequisites \u00b6 Before a request can be actioned by RCIT, the following information is required in relation to Microsoft Purvue eDiscovery: A. Custodian Information \u00b6 Full name of each custodian (internal or external) \ud83d\udccc Examples: Custodian Format \u00b6 Type Example Why \u2705 Acceptable jane.smith@externalfirm.com *@externalfirm.com Email or domain provided for specific, verifiable targeting \u274c Not Acceptable \"Search for someone named Jane Smith from a company called External Firm\" No email or domain; not uniquely identifiable \u274c Not Acceptable \"Search all email from External Firm\" No domain or verified addresses provided; cannot accurately scope Note : Name-only submissions (e.g., \"Search for John Smith\") are not accepted. You must include a unique identifier \u2014 such as an email address or verified mail domain \u2014 especially for external individuals. Ambiguous or incomplete search requests increase risk, reduce accuracy, and violate data minimization practices. Primary email address or UPN (User Principal Name) Department affiliation Specify the official department name. We cannot accept requests scoped to informal sub-groups or teams within a department (e.g., \"Budget Team B\", \"Planning Department\", \"Admin Division\") because there is no authoritative way to verify internal membership. B. Group-Based Requests (Distribution Lists) \u00b6 Do not request use of user-managed distribution lists or unofficial groups. These are often outdated, mismanaged, and contain inaccurate or obsolete entries. RCIT cannot validate their membership and will not correct or review group content for accuracy. If you want to target a group, you must provide a reviewed list of individual email addresses that has been verified for completeness and accuracy \u2014 free of typos, duplicates, or invalid entries. \ud83d\udccc Examples: Group-Based Requests \u00b6 Type Example Why \u2705 Acceptable \"Department of Social Services\" \"DPSS\" Official department name can be matched in Microsoft 365 \u274c Not Acceptable \"COVID-19 Response Team\" \"Budget Approvers DL\" Informal sub-groups or distribution lists are not traceable or validated \u274c Not Acceptable \"DPSS Administrative Division\" \"TLMA Planning Team\" Sub-divisions of departments are not individually tagged in Microsoft 365 \u274c Not Acceptable \"Search all email from External Firm\" No domain or email pattern; too vague to scope properly RCIT cannot search within internal agency \u201csub-groups\u201d because users are only tagged with their official departmental alias in Microsoft 365. For example, if a request asks for \u201call of Children\u2019s Services within DPSS,\u201d we cannot isolate only the Children\u2019s Services Division (CSD). All users are categorized under the broader DPSS department, and there is currently no system-level tag or attribute that distinguishes CSD from other DPSS staff. This limitation stems from how the Department attribute functions in Microsoft 365 and the current capabilities of Microsoft Purview. Microsoft has indicated that support for dynamic group filtering in Purview for government tenants may be introduced in the coming months, which could help resolve this issue. C. Target Date Range \u00b6 Specify: Start and end date (e.g., Jan 1, 2023 \u2013 March 15, 2024) If no range is provided, the system may return excessive, unfiltered results D. Search Criteria \u00b6 You must provide actual, specific search terms or phrases. Do not describe a situation or ask RCIT to \"look around\" a scenario. Vague instructions like those below are not acceptable and will be rejected: Not Acceptable Example Why This Is a Problem \"Search for anything about what happened with the vendor in January\" Too vague; lacks specific keywords, vendor name, or identifiers. \"The original contract\" No document name, keyword, or metadata provided. \"Any contract renewal(s), extension(s), or amendment(s)\" Broad phrasing; needs contract names, parties involved, or identifiers. \"Any correspondence, notices of termination, or communications related to the contract status\" Lacks searchable terms; relies on IT to interpret intent. \"Any and all communications concerning project number 1-2-3-4, including, but not limited to, any and all communications concerning the planned weather drain and connection with Bridge Road going into Atlantis.\" Overly broad; no focused keywords or logical operator use. Use logical operators ( AND , OR , NOT ), quotes for exact phrases where appropriate. Doing so will significantly improve the accuracy of your search results and reduce the volume of irrelevant content. Well-structured queries result in less noise, less manual review work for your team or legal counsel, and lower the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive data such as PII, HIPAA-protected information, or other regulated content due to over-discovery. \ud83d\udccc Search Syntax Examples \u00b6 Example Query Explanation Phrase Match \"project falcon\" Finds messages that contain the exact phrase \"project falcon.\" Keyword Combo \"falcon prototype\" AND \"John Smith\" Finds content only when both \"falcon prototype\" and \"John Smith\" appear in the same document. Exclude Matches (\"data breach\" OR \"security incident\") AND NOT \"test environment\" Finds mentions of incidents, excluding those related to test environments. AND/OR Grouping (\"contract\" OR \"agreement\") AND \"termination\" Finds content mentioning either \"contract\" or \"agreement\" along with \"termination.\" Nested Logic (\"complaint\" OR \"escalation\") AND (\"Jane Doe\" OR \"John Smith\") Finds any complaints or escalations involving either Jane Doe or John Smith.

Do not describe a situation or ask RCIT to \"look around\" a scenario. Vague instructions like those below are not acceptable and will be rejected: Not Acceptable Example Why This Is a Problem \"Search for anything about what happened with the vendor in January\" Too vague; lacks specific keywords, vendor name, or identifiers. \"The original contract\" No document name, keyword, or metadata provided. \"Any contract renewal(s), extension(s), or amendment(s)\" Broad phrasing; needs contract names, parties involved, or identifiers. \"Any correspondence, notices of termination, or communications related to the contract status\" Lacks searchable terms; relies on IT to interpret intent. \"Any and all communications concerning project number 1-2-3-4, including, but not limited to, any and all communications concerning the planned weather drain and connection with Bridge Road going into Atlantis.\" Overly broad; no focused keywords or logical operator use. Use logical operators ( AND , OR , NOT ), quotes for exact phrases where appropriate. Doing so will significantly improve the accuracy of your search results and reduce the volume of irrelevant content. Well-structured queries result in less noise, less manual review work for your team or legal counsel, and lower the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive data such as PII, HIPAA-protected information, or other regulated content due to over-discovery.","title":"D.
