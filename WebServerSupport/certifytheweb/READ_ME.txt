Certify The Web (CTW) Automated Deployment Guide
This guide explains how to deploy Certify The Web on your server using automated PowerShell scripts.
You can deploy CTW in two ways:

Standalone: Independent certificate management on one server
Hub Client: Centrally managed by Management Hub (recommended for multiple servers)


Part 1: Prerequisites
Before you start, you need:

Windows Server 2012 R2 or later
Administrator PowerShell access (Run as Administrator)
Network access to Infoblox (ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us on port 443)
The deployment files in C:\CTW\:

Installer executable (see below)
Configuration export JSON file
Deployment script



For Hub Client Only
If deploying as a Hub Client, you also need:

Management Hub already running (e.g., http://zhr-16webt01.rivcoca.org:8080)
Hub API credentials:

Client ID: managedinstance_sp_01
Client Secret: (use management Hub Joining key under stored credentials)




Choose Your Deployment Type
When to Use Standalone
✓ Single server deployment
✓ Independent certificate management
✓ No need for central management
✓ Testing or proof-of-concept
Files needed:


certifytheweb_standalone_export.json
Deploy-CTW-Standalone.ps1
use certifytheweb_staging_export.json (for testing on dev servers or workstations)

When to Use Hub Client
✓ Multiple servers (S1, S2, S3, S4)
✓ Centralized certificate management
✓ Manage all instances from one dashboard
✓ Shared configuration and monitoring
Files needed:

certifytheweb_hub_export.json
Deploy-CTW-HubClient.ps1




STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT
Step 1: 
run Deploy-CTW-Standalone.ps1 as admin in Powershell CLI

Note: The file will download and install automatically.

Step 2: 

Import Configuration

Go to Settings > Import & Export
Click "Preview Import.."
Select: C:\CTW\certifytheweb_standalone_export.json
Enter the configuration password (ask your admin if you don't have it)
Click OK to complete import

Your certificates and configurations will now appear.

The configuration file (certifytheweb_standalone_export.json) contains:

✓ Let's Encrypt account configuration
✓ Infoblox credentials for DNS validation
✓ Stored certificate passwords
✓ Any pre-existing certificate configurations

Make sure this file is in: C:\CTW\certifytheweb_standalone_export.json

Hub Details:
  API URL: http://zhr-16webt01.rivcoca.org:8080
  Client ID: managedinstance_sp_01

Verify in Management Hub:
  Management Hub > Instances > Should see this instance listed

After Hub Client Deployment
Verify Instance in Hub

for Admins:

Open Management Hub: http://zhr-16webt01.rivcoca.org:8080
Go to Certificates > Summary
Look at Managed Instances section
Your new instance should be listed

Manage from Hub

Go to Certificates > New
Select your instance as the Target Instance
Add domains and request certificates
Hub handles everything centrally

Open Local CTW UI (Optional)
You can still open the local CTW interface:

Press Windows Key
Search for: Certify
Open "Certify The Web"

The local UI works alongside Hub management.

Troubleshooting
"Administrator PowerShell Required"
Problem: Script won't run
Solution:

Right-click PowerShell

Problem: Config file missing
Solution:

Verify the file is in C:\CTW\
Check the filename matches exactly
Get the file from your admin if missing


"Cannot Connect to Infoblox"
Problem: Infoblox DNS validation fails during certificate requests
Solution:

Verify your server can reach: ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us

Open PowerShell and type: Test-NetConnection ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us -Port 443
Should see: TcpTestSucceeded : True


If it fails, contact your network team:

"Please allow outbound access from this server to ns2mgmt.riverside.ca.us:443"


"Cannot Connect to Hub"
Problem: Instance won't join Hub
Solution:

Verify Hub URL is correct and running
Verify Client Secret is correct
Test connectivity:

powershell   Test-NetConnection zhr-16webt01.rivcoca.org -Port 8080

If it fails, contact your network team:

"Please allow outbound access from this server to zhr-16webt01.rivcoca.org:8080"


"Hub Instance Not Appearing"

Common Questions
Q: Do I need to restart after deployment?
A: Not required, but a restart is safe if desired.
Q: Will my existing certificates be affected?
A: No. The configuration import restores previous settings without making changes.
Q: Can I run the script multiple times?
A: Yes, it's safe to run again. Re-running won't cause issues.
Q: What if the script fails halfway?
A: You can run it again. It will complete the remaining steps.
Q: Can I switch from Standalone to Hub later?
A: Yes. Uninstall standalone and deploy as Hub Client. Your config exports can be reused.
