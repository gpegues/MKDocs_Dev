# Export a Wiki to a OneNote Notebook in Microsoft Teams

Teams is phasing out Wiki support. You can continue to access and edit existing wikis, but you can't create new wikis in Teams channels. Soon, customers who have OneNote enabled in Teams and Microsoft 365 will be able to export their Wiki content to OneNote.

## OneNote provides the following capabilities:

- Collaboration across the team's channel
- Visibility of all channel notes in one place, organized within a single OneNote notebook
- Rich editing features, such as typing, ink annotations, highlighting, and file attachments
- The ability to use any platform to recall and search channel notes within OneNote

**Note:** Only notebooks stored on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business are supported in Teams.

### Export a Wiki to OneNote

This option is only available for standard channels.

1. In Teams, go to whatever channel has the wiki you want to export.
2. In the Wiki tab, select **Get details > Export to Notes > Finish**.
3. Go to the Notes tab to access your content.

    - Each tab of the former wiki is now a OneNote notebook section.
    - Each page of the former wiki is now a page in a OneNote notebook section.

After exporting, you can go to the Notes tab to collaborate using OneNote in your Teams channel. A read-only version of your wiki will continue to be available in the Wiki tab for now.

### Wiki Deprecation FAQ

**What's the timeline for Wiki's deprecation?**

Wiki will be retired along the following stages:

- **Stage 1: Rolled out (October 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD)**
  - Users won't be able to create new wikis, but they will be able to access—that is, read and write for—their existing wikis. Users can also export their content to OneNote. Once a user has done so, the Wiki version will be read-only.
  - After exporting, each wiki in a channel will appear as a separate section in OneNote, and each wiki page will be a separate OneNote page.

- **Stage 2: Early October 2023 (November 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD)**
  - In this stage, channels' Wiki tabs will no longer be supported. Users will still be able to access—that is, read and write—content in the Wiki app. It will be easy to navigate from the deprecated channel Wiki tabs to the Wiki app. Users will also be able to export their content to OneNote. As in Stage 1, it will no longer be possible to create new wikis.

- **Stage 3: January 2024 (April 2024 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD)**
  - From this point onward, neither Wiki tabs nor the Wiki app will be accessible through Teams. Users will no longer have the ability to export their wikis. However, users will still be able to download their wiki files from SharePoint.

**Can I export my wikis in bulk?**
No. Users will need to export wikis one by one using the Wiki tab.

**Who can export a wiki to a Notes tab?**
Any team member who has the ability to add or remove a tab in a channel can export their wiki.

**What will happen to wikis in private channels?**
Private channel wikis will also be deprecated. Unlike with standard channels, there will be no migration experience for private channels, so users will need to copy-paste the content into OneNote manually.
