### **Important Update: Changes to Note-Taking (Wiki) in Microsoft Teams**
#### **Introduction of "Notes" Tab in New Standard Channels**

On behalf of RCIT, to all Riverside County Agencies,

This notification is to inform of an upcoming change in Microsoft Teams which will enhance your note-taking experience. A new **"Notes"** tab, powered by OneNote, _**will replace the current Wiki Tab and functionality in Teams**_.

#### **Why the change?**

**Microsoft is phasing out Microsoft Teams Wiki support.** 

However, the shift from Wiki to OneNote in Teams is part of Microsoft's continual effort to improve functionality and user experience. 
As this change slowly rolls out over the next several months, you will be able to temporarily continue to access and edit existing wikis, but you will not be able to create new wikis in Teams channels.
Soon, customers who have OneNote enabled in Teams and Microsoft 365 will be able to export their Wiki content to OneNote. You may have already noticed this option in your Microsoft Teams Client.

_OneNote provides the following capabilities:_

- **Collaboration across the team's channel**
- **Visibility of all channel notes in one place**, organized within a single OneNote notebook
- **Rich editing features**, such as typing, ink annotations, highlighting, and file attachments
- **The ability to use any platform** to recall and search channel notes within OneNote

_Only notebooks stored on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business are supported in Teams._

#### **What This Change Means for You**

- **New "Notes" Tab:** When creating a new standard channel in Teams, a "Notes" tab will automatically appear. 
- **Powered by OneNote:** This tab will leverage OneNote for enhanced note-taking capabilities, including easy collaboration, rich editing options, and effective search functionalities.
- **Organization & Access:** All notes for a channel will be organized within a dedicated section in the team's default OneNote notebook.

#### **Action Required**

- **Adapting to Change (Training):** Familiarize yourself with OneNote for seamless integration into your Teams usage.
- **Migrate your Wiki data:** Migration of your Wiki data to Onenote is required and is a user driven action.
  - _An additional document will also be provided with user oriented migration instructions, as this process is intended to be completed by members of the respective Team where the wiki resides._

#### **FAQs**

Microsoft is implementing these changes over the next several months in stages. There are no specific dates, only general timelines. 

**Rollout Start:** Mid-November 2023

**Rollout Completion:** Late November 2023

- **Stage 1:** Rolled out (October 2023/November 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD)
Users won't be able to create new wikis, but they will be able to access—that is, read and write for—their existing wikis. Users can also export their content to OneNote. Once a user has done so, the Wiki version will be read-only.
After exporting, each wiki in a channel will appear as a separate section in OneNote, and each wiki page will be a separate OneNote page.  

- **Stage 2:** Early October 2023 (November 2023 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD)
In this stage, channels' Wiki tabs will no longer be supported. Users will still be able to access—that is, read and write—content in the Wiki app. It will be easy to navigate from the deprecated channel Wiki tabs to the Wiki app. Users will also be able to export their content to OneNote. As in Stage 1, it will no longer be possible to create new wikis. 

- **Stage 3:** January 2024 (April 2024 for GCC, GCCH, and DoD)
From this point onward, neither Wiki tabs nor the Wiki app will be accessible through Teams. Users will no longer have the ability to export their wikis. However, users will still be able to download their wiki files from SharePoint.
