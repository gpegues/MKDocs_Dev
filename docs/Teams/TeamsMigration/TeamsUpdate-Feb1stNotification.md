# [End of Availability for Classic Teams Client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability)

## Overview
On March 31, 2024, a new Teams client will be rolled out for users who are still on classic Teams, installing the new Teams client for them and uninstalling the classic Teams client. After this time, classic Teams will be unavailable. As part of this process in the coming weeks, individuals using the Classic Teams Client can expect the following items to occur.

### User experience
#### What users will see until March 31, 2024
Starting on February 1, 2024, any classic Teams users who haven't updated to new Teams will begin seeing an informational banner to remind them about the timeline for the auto update. This banner will appear in the main Teams client window at the top of the page (underneath the main bar).

* You can dismiss this banner in every client session until the end of February 2024, but it will reappear with each client launch.

Classic Teams will remain available to use until March 31, 2024. However, we highly encourage admins to update their users to new Teams, as new features are only being added to the new Teams client. Learn more in the [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies article](link).

#### What users will experience after March 31, 2024
After March 31, 2024, if you’re already running on new Teams, there will be no change in behavior. Your Teams will continue working as expected.

Users on classic Teams will be automatically updated to the new Teams client. Users won’t be able to switch back to classic Teams after this date, because classic Teams won’t be functional. Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams.
