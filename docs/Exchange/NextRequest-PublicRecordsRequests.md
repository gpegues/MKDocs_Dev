# NextRequest Guidelines

## Handling Public Records Requests

### Requests Involving Multiple Departments

- **Countywide Requests**:  
  When a request is made for all county departments to produce records, the **Executive Office (EO)**, with assistance from **County Counsel**, will manage the external responses to the requestor on behalf of the county.  
  - The EO will collaborate with all departments to ensure records are received and produced within the required timeframes.

- **Requests from Media Members**:  
  If the request is from a member of the media:  
  - The **Executive Office** will handle communication and responses directly with the requestor.  
  - Individual departments must still search for potentially responsive records and upload them to the **NextRequest** system for review by the EO and County Counsel.  
  - The EO will release the records to the requestor.

- **Requests for Specific Departments**:  
  When a request targets **specific departments** (not countywide):  
  - The **lead department** will ensure timelines are met and provide external responses within the required timeframes.  
  - The lead department is responsible for closing the request.

- **Departmental Responsibilities**:  
  Each department must:  
  - Gather responsive documents within their respective departments.  
  - Use **NextRequest** for communication to ensure transparency and clarity across all departments.  
    - This ensures all parties are notified once a request has been fulfilled and is ready for closure.

### Duplicate Public Records Requests

If a public records request is **duplicated** and sent to multiple departments:  

- Departments must **consult with County Counsel** to confirm whether the request is truly a duplicate or a similar request with variations.  
- Once confirmed as a duplicate:  
  - Each department can close the duplicate request individually.  
  - The **Executive Office** may also close duplicate requests on behalf of the departments.

### Requests for Emails Involving Other Departments

If a public records request includes **potentially responsive emails**:  

- **Countywide Email Requests**:  
  - One department should assign **RCIT** to pull emails for all relevant county departments.  
  - Review notes in **NextRequest** to determine if action has already been requested from RCIT.

- **Media Requests for Emails**:  
  - The **Executive Office** can assign RCIT to pull emails when the request is from a member of the media.

- **Best Practices**:  
  The department responsible for the response (including reviewing and producing emails) should:  
  - Notify other departments of potentially responsive emails involving their respective departments.
